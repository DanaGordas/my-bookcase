            Hi! I am Dana Gordas and I've been an avid reader my entire life. I've also recently become a programmer and I've been trying to find a way to combine my passion for literature and code and the result is this website. I've selected a few books that I can highly recommend and for which I've written a short description and some personal thoughts.
            I hope you find among my recommendations your next favourite book or just something inspiring to read.
            <br>The picture on the right was taken by my talented friend <a href="https://www.baldovinphotography.com/" target="_blank"> Pia Baldovin</a> during a trip to Ireland we took together in 2018.
