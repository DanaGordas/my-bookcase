            Hi! I am Dana Gordas and I've been an avid reader my entire life. I've also recently become a programmer and I've been trying to find a way to combine my passion for literature and code and the result is this website. I've selected a few books that I can highly recommend and for which I've written a short description and some personal thoughts.
            I hope you find among my recommendations your next favourite book or just something inspiring to read.

          <h4>Tales of the City</h4>
          <p><em>Written by Armistead Maupin</em></p>
          <p>I was in the mood to read something light but entertaining this summer so I started with the first of the 9 novel series Tales of the City. I loved the shows (both the new one and the one from the 90s) and was waiting for the right mood to read the books. The book follows the adventures of Mary Ann Singleton, a naive young woman from Cleveland, who moves to San Francisco on an impulse decision while visiting. She finds an apartment at 28 Barbary Lane, which is owned by eccentric weed-smoker/grower landlady Anna Madrigal. Mary Ann becomes friends with other tenants of the building, a lovely mix of hippyish and queer people. </p>
